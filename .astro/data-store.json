You can view them [here](https://expressive-code.com/guides/themes/#available-themes). A website can have one or more themes, defined in `src/site.config.ts`. There are three theming modes to choose from:\n\n1. `single`: Choose a single theme for the website. Simple.\n2. `light-dark-auto`: Choose two themes for the website to use for light and dark mode. The header will include a button for toggling between light/dark/auto. For example, you could choose `github-dark` and `github-light` with a default of `\"auto\"` and the user's experience will match their operating system theme straight away.\n3. `select`: Choose two or more themes for the website and include a button in the header to change between any of these themes. You could include as many Shiki themes from Expressive Code as you like. Allow users to find their favorite theme!\n\n> When the user changes the theme, their preference is stored in `localStorage` to persist across page navigation.\n\n## Code Blocks\n\nLet's look at some code block styles:\n\n```python\ndef hello_world():\n    print(\"Hello, world!\")\n\nhello_world()\n```\n\n```python title=\"hello.py\"\ndef hello_world():\n    print(\"Hello, world!\")\n\nhello_world()\n```\n\n```shell\npython hello.py\n```\n\nAlso some inline code: `1 + 2 = 3`. Or maybe even `(= (+ 1 2) 3)`.\n\nSee the [Expressive Code Docs](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/syntax-highlighting/) for more information on available features like wrapping text, line highlighting, diffs, etc.\n\n## Basic Markdown Elements\n\n- List item 1\n- List item 2\n\n**Bold text**\n\n_Italic text_\n\n~~Strikethrough text~~\n\n[Link](https://www.example.com)\n\n> In life, as in art, some endings are bittersweet. Especially when it comes to love. Sometimes fate throws two lovers together only to rip them apart. Sometimes the hero finally makes the right choice but the timing is all wrong.

Just add `#pixelated` to the very end of the alt string.\n\n![Pixel art of a tree #pixelated](./PixelatedGreenTreeSide.png 'But adding #pixelated to the end of the alt string fixes this')\n\n```md title=\"Pixel art markdown with #pixelated\" wrap\n![Pixel art of a tree #pixelated](./PixelatedGreenTreeSide.png 'But adding #pixelated to the end of the alt string fixes this')\n```\n\n## Admonitions\n\n```md title=\"Admonition example in markdown\"\n:::note\ntesting123\n:::\n```\n\n:::note\ntesting123\n:::\n\n:::tip\ntesting123\n:::\n\n:::important\ntesting123\n:::\n\n:::caution\ntesting123\n:::\n\n:::warning\ntesting123\n:::\n\n## Character Chats\n\n```md title=\"Custom character chat\" wrap\n:::duck\n**Did you know?** You can easily create custom character chats for your blog with MultiTerm!\n:::\n```\n\n:::duck\n**Did you know?** You can easily create custom character chats for your blog with MultiTerm!\n:::\n\n### Adding Your Own\n\nTo add your own character, first add an image file to the top-level `/public` directory in your cloned MultiTerm repo. Astro cannot automatically optimize image assets from markdown plugins, so make sure to compress the image to a web-friendly size (\u003C100kb).\n\nI recommend Google's free [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) web app for creating super small webp files. The characters here have been resized to 300 pixels wide and exported to webp with 75% quality using Squoosh.\n\nAfter you've added your image, update the `characters` option in `site.config.ts` with your newly added image file and restart the development server.\n\n### Character Conversations\n\nWhen there are multiple character chats in a row, the order of the chat image and chat bubble reverses to give the chat more of a back-and-forth appearance.\n\n```md title=\"Sequential character chats\"\n:::owl\nThis is a cool feature!\n:::\n\n:::unicorn\nI agree!\n:::\n```\n\n:::owl\nThis is a cool feature!\n:::\n\n:::unicorn\nI agree!\n:::\n\nYou can specify the alignment (`left` or `right`) to override the default `left, right, left, ...` ordering.\n\n```md wrap title=\"Character chats with specific alignment\"\n:::unicorn{align=\"right\"}\nOver here, to the right!\n:::\n```\n\n:::unicorn{align=\"right\"}\nOver here, to the right!\n:::\n\n## GitHub Cards\n\nGitHub overview cards heavily inspired by [Astro Cactus](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus).\n\n```md title=\"GitHub repo card example in markdown\"\n::github{repo=\"stelcodes/multiterm-astro\"}\n```\n\n::github{repo=\"stelcodes/multiterm-astro\"}\n\n```md wrap=true title=\"GitHub user card example in markdown\"\n::github{user=\"withastro\"}\n```\n\n::github{user=\"withastro\"}\n\n## Emoji :star_struck:\n\nEmojis can be added in markdown by including a literal emoji character or a GitHub shortcode.
