        <h2>Online space game with JavaScript</h2>
        <h3>Project time: 1 month. Completed on: 05-2020</h3>
        <p>A spin-off of asteroids, this is my first project using prototype-based object-oriented programming. This new
            syntax was, as first, difficult to grasp. However, it showed all the same benefits as a classical
            object-oriented style. I made liberal use of inheritance and subclasses to reuse code. JavaScript does not
            allow for multiple inheritance, so it was much easier coding knowing that some method and attribute
            conflicts could not happen. A major feature to this program was the ability to download all the assets
            before playing the game, instead of loading on-demand, which can take a toll on devices with slow internet
            connectivity. This was the first loader I built, and I am very happy with the modular functionality that it
            provides, which I can use in other projects as well.</p>

        <h2>Asteroids game using python</h2>
        <h3>Project time: 3.5 weeks. Completed on: 30-03-2020</h3>
        <p>This is a simple asteroid clone, developed on Python with turtle and tkinter, used for graphics and UI,
            respectively. This project was my first time writing code in a classical object-oriented style. I used
            classes extensively, and almost everything was sorted in hierarchies. This made code reuse much simpler, and
            allowed me to store all the objects in one list, each with similar methods instead of needing to manage many
            lists, which is much more difficult and confusing. Recursive functions were immensely helpful in this
            project, as they mimicked multiple loops running simultaneously without having to use threads.</p>

        <h2>Pong game using python</h2>
        <h3>Project time: 2 weeks. Completed: 05-03-2020</h3>
        <p>An imitation of one of the first video games, this is my first game using python graphics. I experimented
            with turtle graphics and pygame mixer, while applying various areas of mathematics such as Cartesian
            coordinates, right-triangle trigonometry, and varying rates of change. I also used my knowledge about
            physics to create smooth, realistic motion (however, there are far too many asteroids onscreen for this to
            use this technique for them). While creating this game, I learned to optimize functions, especially those in
            nested loops, as small millisecond increases in the time to execute functions such as collision detection
            allow for a much more enjoyable experience.</p>
