Writing simulations isn't one of my main interests, per se, but it is pretty useful for controls engineering. Also, I couldn't get my hands on a [pendant made by mitxela](https://mitxela.com/projects/fluid-pendant) in time, so I plan to make my own version at some point. Hence, I decided to do this FLIP (**FL**uid **I**mplicit **P**article) simulation, using [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmzBREkK8kY) by Ten Minute Physics as a reference.
